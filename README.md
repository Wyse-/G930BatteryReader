# G930BatteryReader
This is a simple program written in C and compiled using Code::Blocks 16.01 and GCC. 

Its purpose is reading the battery value from the Logitech G930 software and writing the battey value to a txt file.

It has only been tested on Windows 7 x64 using version 1.00.364 of the Logitech G930 software (x64 as well): the download link is included below.

This will NOT work with the newer "Logitech Gaming Software".

You are free to use this program and its code however you want.
